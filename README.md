This repo contains code for the [**NEJM AI**](https://ai.nejm.org/) original article "[Artificial Intelligence Identifies Factors Associated with Blood Loss and Surgical Experience in Cholecystectomy](https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIoa2300088)". 

### Requirements
```
conda env create -n lapnet -f env.yml
conda activate lapnet
```

### Usage

#### Dataset format
For use on a custom dataset, the surgical video data must be saved as RGB frames on disk in the following format:
```
root
└───video_dataset
    │   annotations.txt
    └───rgb
        │   00370-35490
        |   |   img_000000001.jpg
        |   |   img_000000002.jpg
        |       ...
        |   |   img_000033415.jpg
        │   ...
```
Where `annotations.txt` contains a list of actions with start and stop frames and class labels. This file can be created using the scripts provided in the `utils` folder. One should upload all frames at the available sampling rate into the `rgb` folder (there's also a helpful script for writing video frames to `rgb`).

#### Training
To train the temporal network, run the following command:
```
python run.py logging=True
```
to use WandB logging capabilities. 

To configure data augmentations, enable the available flags by overriding Hydra constants. For example, to enable mixup with alpha 0.8, run the following command:
```
python run.py logging=True temp_dataset.temp_augs_enable_mixup=True temp_dataset.temp_augs_mixup_lam=0.8
```
See the `configs` folder for more details.

#### Evaluation
To evaluate a trained model, run `python eval.py`.

#### Predictions on whole videos
To get the temporal action segmentation predictions on whole surgical videos `python test.py`. This will produce annotations files like the ground truth csvs that would be in `temp_anns`. 

#### Computer vision feature extraction
To extract the surgical activity features used in this study, run `python extract_features.py` (make sure to change the file accordingly given your available clinical metadata).

#### Statistical inference
```
